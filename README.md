# My Personal Landing Page

Contained herein is the source code for my personal landing page and site.  This repository will serve as a place to host my digital identity along with some thoughts and ideas.

The site has been built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and is served by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

For the moment, this is little more that a digital business card, but I'll likely share about Linux, privacy, security, and system administration.

##  What Have We Got Here Now?

-   A clean, minimalist layout that looks great on all devices.
-   A slick light/dark theme switcher. 
-   My Gravatar avatar.
-   Links to my social media and messaging profiles.

##  What'll Be Added Later?

-   Posts on Linux, privacy, and security.
-   A work history and resumé section.
-   Highlights/Lowlights from sysops projects, How-To docs, scripts, more.

##  How's This Thing Built?

This site is proudly static. No databases, no complex server-side logic—just pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript generated by Hugo.

-   **Engine:** [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - The world's fastest static site generator.
-   **Hosting:** [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - Free hosting from the folks at GitHub.
-   **Deployment:** A simple [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) workflow that builds and deploys the site on every push to the `main` branch.

##  How Can I do This?

With Hugo, creating a starter template for your site, adding content, site configuration, and publishing are straightforward.  Hugo provides a [quick start guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/).

1.  **Install Hugo:**
    
    See the installation instructions for your [specific platform](https://gohugo.io/installation/). I'll assume you're using your preferred Linux distribution.

    **Debian/Ubuntu** 
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y hugo
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
    **Fedora/RedHat**
    
    ```bash
    sudo dnf install hugo
    ```
2.  **Create Your Site:**

    Use the `new` command to create a site
    
    ```bash
    hugo new site example_dotcom 
    cd example_dotcom
    ```
3.  **Choose and Apply a Theme:** 

    Select your Hugo [theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/), and install it with `git clone` from the themes directory
    
    ```bash
    cd themes
    git clone https://github.com/theNewDynamic/go-hugo-theme-ananke.git
    cd ..
    echo "theme = 'ananke'" >> hugo.toml
    git init
    ```
         
4.  **Start the Server:**  

    ```bash
    hugo server -D 
    ```
    (The `-D` flag includes content marked as a draft, which can be useful for development).

5.  **View Your Site in a Browser:** 
    
    Open [`http://localhost:1313`](http://localhost:1313/) to see the site live.
    
6.  **Add Some Content:**

    ```bash
    hugo new content content/posts/first-post.md
    ```
    Open first-post.md in your editor, then add and save some [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown). Restart the server to see your content.

7.  **Adjust the Configuration to Your Liking:**
    
    See [configuration documentation](https://gohugo.io/configuration/) for more.
    
    
Now you've got a good starting point for your own site! Well done!
